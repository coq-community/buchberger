This directory contains the formalization of Buchberger's algorithm.


It is composed of :

-  A proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in 
    `A machine checked implementation of Buchberger's algorithm' in JAR Jan. 
2001.

- An implementation of the algorithm. With respect to the paper,
  terms are not abstracted but built directly from coef and monomials.

- A constructive proof of Dickson's lemma due to Henrik Persson

To build the directory, do

  coq_makefile *.v > Makefile

Then

  make depend;make all
  
In Extract.v we explain how the extracted code produced in
the file sin_num.ml can be used to compute Grobner basis.
