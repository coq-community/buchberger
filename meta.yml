  ## Documentation

  This project contains a Coq formalization of Buchberger's algorithm.
  It is composed of:
  - A proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in
   [A machine checked implementation of Buchberger's algorithm][jar-url],
   Journal of Automated Reasoning, January 2001.
  - An implementation of the algorithm. With respect to the paper,
    terms are not abstracted but built directly from coef and monomials.
  - A constructive proof of Dickson's lemma due to Henrik Persson.

  In the file `Extract.v`, it is explained how the extracted code found in
  `sin_num.ml` can be used to compute Gröbner bases.

  ## Related work

  An alternative formalization of Gröbner bases in Coq using the SSReflect
  proof language and the Mathematical Components library is available
  [elsewhere][grobner-url].
